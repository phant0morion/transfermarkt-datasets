# Streamlit Cloud Python Version Fix

## Issue Identified
Streamlit Cloud was failing to deploy due to Python version compatibility issues:
- Cloud was using Python 3.13.3
- Poetry configuration restricted to `>=3.8.1, <3.11, !=3.9.7` (old constraint)
- This caused dependency installation failures with "Python version not allowed" error

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Runtime Specification** 📋
- Created `runtime.txt` specifying `python-3.10.12`
- This forces Streamlit Cloud to use a compatible Python version

### 2. **Updated Poetry Configuration** 🔄
- Regenerated `poetry.lock` file with current pyproject.toml constraints
- The pyproject.toml already allows Python up to `<3.14`, so Python 3.10.12 is compatible

### 3. **Alternative Dependency Management** 📦
- Enhanced `requirements.txt` with pinned version ranges for stability
- Created `setup.py` as backup dependency specification
- Added `packages.txt` for system-level dependencies (git)

### 4. **Cloud-Optimized Configuration** ⚙️
- Updated `.streamlit/config.toml` with cloud-specific settings:
  - `headless = true`
  - `fileWatcherType = "none"`
  - Reduced logging level to "warning"
  - Disabled magic execution for performance
  - Enhanced security settings

### 5. **Deployment Secrets** 🔐
- Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for cloud environment detection

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.10.12 for Streamlit Cloud
- `packages.txt` - System packages (git)
- `setup.py` - Alternative dependency specification
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Cloud deployment configuration

### Updated Files:
- `poetry.lock` - Regenerated with current constraints
- `requirements.txt` - Enhanced with version pinning
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Cloud-optimized settings

## Expected Results

1. **Dependency Installation Success** ✅
   - Streamlit Cloud will use Python 3.10.12 (compatible version)
   - Poetry or pip will successfully install all dependencies

2. **Faster Health Check Response** ⚡
   - Optimized configuration reduces startup time
   - Health check endpoints respond immediately

3. **Improved Stability** 🛡️
   - Version pinning prevents dependency conflicts
   - Cloud-specific settings reduce resource usage

4. **Better Error Handling** 🔧
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
   - Clear error messages for debugging

## Deployment Priority
Deploy these files in this order:
1. `runtime.txt` (most critical - fixes Python version)
2. `poetry.lock` (updated dependencies)
3. `.streamlit/config.toml` (performance optimizations)
4. `requirements.txt` (backup dependency management)
5. Other files (additional support)

## Success Indicators
- ✅ No "Python version not allowed" errors in logs
- ✅ Successful dependency installation
- ✅ App starts and responds to health checks
- ✅ Normal application functionality restored
