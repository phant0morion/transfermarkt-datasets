# Streamlit Cloud Optimizations Applied

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Health Check Optimization
- **File**: `07_interactive_data_export.py`
- **Change**: Added immediate health check response before any heavy operations
- **Details**: Health check query parameter `?healthcheck=1` returns "OK" immediately

### 2. Memory Management
- **Files**: `07_interactive_data_export.py`, `.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added TTL caching (3600s for dataset, 1800s for queries)
  - Limited cache entries (max_entries=3-10 depending on function)
  - Added session state management for dataset persistence
  - Configured memory management in Streamlit config

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **File**: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Changes**:
  - Disabled file watching (`fileWatcherType = "none"`)
  - Enabled headless mode for cloud
  - Disabled development features
  - Optimized caching settings

### 4. Error Handling
- **File**: `07_interactive_data_export.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced try-catch blocks around data loading
  - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
  - Improved error messages

### 5. Code Cleanup
- **Files**: `dataset.py`, `utils.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed debug print statements
  - Streamlined path detection logic
  - Improved cloud/local environment detection

### 6. DuckDB Query Optimization
- **File**: `07_interactive_data_export.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Parameterized queries for better performance
  - Proper memory management for DuckDB connections
  - Reduced cache TTL for data queries (30 min vs 1 hour)

## Expected Results

1. **Faster Health Checks**: Health check endpoint responds immediately without loading dataset
2. **Better Memory Management**: Reduced memory pressure through caching limits and TTL
3. **Improved Stability**: Session state management prevents unnecessary reloads
4. **Cloud Compatibility**: Optimized configuration for Streamlit Cloud environment

## Files Modified

- `/streamlit/pages/07_interactive_data_export.py` - Main app with optimizations
- `/streamlit/.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `/transfermarkt_datasets/core/dataset.py` - Removed debug output
- `/streamlit/utils.py` - Cleaned up path detection

## Testing

The app has been tested locally and all syntax errors have been resolved. The health check functionality is implemented and ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment.
